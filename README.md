**Customer Segmentation Project Guide**

**1\. Business Problem**

The company lacks detailed information about customer characteristics and purchase behavior, leading to ineffective marketing campaigns and the inability to personalize shopping experiences. This project aims to address the following objectives:

- Understand Customer Needs and Preferences: Gain insights into customers' purchasing patterns and behaviors.
- Targeted Marketing and Communication: Implement data-driven marketing strategies to reach specific customer segments.
- Product Development and Innovation: Identify popular products and gaps in offerings to support product development.
- Optimize Pricing Strategies: Analyze purchasing patterns to identify optimal pricing for different customer segments.
- Enhance Customer Experience: Develop personalized interactions based on customer behavior.
- Resource Allocation and Efficiency: Allocate resources effectively based on the value and behavior of each customer segment.

**2\. Project Outline**

**I. Get Data**

1. Import Necessary Libraries:
2. Import and Read Data:
    - Load the dataset (e.g., from CSV or database) and view its structure.

**II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Cleaning**

1\. General Information about the Data

- Inspect Data:
  - Use data.info(), data.shape, and data.describe() to understand the basic structure, size, and distribution of the dataset.
- Check the Number of Columns (Variables):
  - Identify and classify the variables into categorical, numerical, and temporal features:
    - Categorical Features: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, CustomerID, Country.
    - Numerical Features: Quantity, UnitPrice.
    - Temporal Feature: InvoiceDate.

2\. Handling Missing Values

- Identify Missing Values:
  - Calculate the percentage of missing values for each column and visualize using a bar chart.
  - Focus on handling missing values in CustomerID.
    - Consider replacing missing CustomerID values based on InvoiceNo or removing rows with missing CustomerID entries.

3\. Data Cleaning

- Remove Duplicates:
  - Identify and drop duplicate rows using data.drop_duplicates().
- Handle Data Types:
  - Convert columns to appropriate data types:
    - Categorical: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, CustomerID, Country.
    - Numerical: Quantity, UnitPrice.
    - Temporal: InvoiceDate -> Convert to datetime format.

4\. Handling Outliers in Numerical Variables

- Outlier Detection and Handling:
  - Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect and handle outliers.
  - Replace outliers with the lower and upper bounds.

5\. Handling Special Cases in Quantity and UnitPrice

- UnitPrice:
  - Replace UnitPrice = 0 with the mode (most common price) for each StockCode.
  - Visualize the distribution of UnitPrice using a boxplot.
- Quantity:
  - Check for Quantity < 0, which might indicate canceled transactions.
  - Calculate the percentage of canceled orders over total orders.
  - Validate two assumptions:
        1. Each canceled order is independent.
        2. Each canceled order has a counterpart with the exact same quantity in the dataset.
  - Remove canceled transactions that have no corresponding orders.

6\. EDA for Categorical Variables

- Summary Statistics for Categorical Variables:
  - Explore categorical variables, such as the number of unique products, customers, and countries.
- Bivariate Analysis:
  - Create visualizations to explore the relationships between Country and CustomerID, as well as Description (Product) and CustomerID.

III. Store Transaction and Product Information into MongoDB

1. Store cleaned transaction and product data into MongoDB.
2. Retrieve data from MongoDB and create sales reports by product category and customer segments using tools like Jupyter Notebook and Excel.

**IV. Feature Engineering (Perform Customer Segmentation)**

1\. Create RFM Model

- Recency (R): Number of days since the last purchase.
- Frequency (F): Total number of invoices submitted by each customer.
- Monetary (M): Total monetary value of each customerâ€™s purchases.
- Create RFM DataFrame:
  - Columns: CustomerID, Recency, Frequency, Monetary.

2\. K-means Clustering

- Preprocessing:
  - Scale the RFM data to bring attributes to the same scale using StandardScaler.
- Determine Optimal Number of Clusters:
  - Use the Elbow Method to choose the optimal number of clusters by plotting distortion scores against the number of clusters.
  - Evaluate the model using the Silhouette Score.
- Model Building:
  - Fit K-means with the selected number of clusters and assign labels to each customer.
- Cluster Analysis:
  - Apply the clustering results back to the RFM DataFrame and analyze the characteristics of each cluster.
- Cluster Characteristics:
  - Cluster 0: Inactive Customers - High recency, low frequency, low monetary.
  - Cluster 1: Potential Customers - Moderate recency, moderate frequency, and monetary.
  - Cluster 2: High-value Customers - Low recency, high frequency, high monetary.
  - Cluster 3: Loyal Customers - Moderate recency, high frequency, high monetary.

**V. Implementation and Interpretation**

- Create Dashboard:
  - Build visualizations to present cluster insights (Power BI Dashboard)
  - Highlight key characteristics and actionable recommendations for each segment.
- Business Strategy:
  - For Inactive Customers: Launch re-engagement campaigns to increase interest.
  - For Potential Customers: Offer personalized discounts to encourage purchases.
  - For High-value Customers: Provide loyalty rewards and exclusive offers.
  - For Loyal Customers: Focus on retention strategies and premium services.
